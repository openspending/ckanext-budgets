CKAN Budgets
============

A `CKAN <http://ckan.org/>`__ extension that improves handling of budget
data in CKAN. Central to the budget data handling are `budget data
packages <https://github.com/openspending/budget-data-package>`__.

When a CSV file is uploaded to CKAN and the CSV includes all of the
headers defined in the budget data package specification, the dataset is
automatically converted into a budget data package (i.e. it can be
exported as a budget data package). So automatically the budget data
distribution is standardised and becomes usable in the different tools
that support budget data packages.

Installation
------------

This CKAN extension can be installed via `pypi <http://pypi.python.org>`__ using ``pip``::

    pip install ckanext-budgets

If you have followed the `CKAN installation documentation <http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/installing/install-from-source.html>`__ remember to activate your CKAN environment (virtual environment) before installing the extension::

    . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

Then add ``budgets`` to the list in ``ckan.plugins`` in your CKAN
configuration file. Restart your webserver and budget data is
automatically handled for you.

   data package specification used.
